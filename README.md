The S-Space Package is a collection of algorithms for building Semantic Spaces
as well as a highly-scalable library for designing new distributional semantics
algorithms. Distributional algorithms process text corpora and represent the
semantic for words as high dimensional feature vectors. These approaches are
known by many names, such as word spaces, semantic spaces, or distributed
semantics and rest upon the Distributional Hypothesis: words that appear in
similar contexts have similar meanings.

The research and development is being done by the Natural Language Processing
group at UCLA led by David Jurgens and Keith Stevens, under the advisory of Dr.
Michael Dyer.

See the [Getting Started](../../wiki/GettingStarted) page for
a quick introduction on how to use the S-Space package, see the [Package
Overview](../../wiki/PackageLayout) for information on the
code and available features, or dive right into the
[Javadoc](http://fozziethebeat.github.com/S-Space/apidocs/) to see what's
available now.  For any questions, please contact us via our mailing lists:
