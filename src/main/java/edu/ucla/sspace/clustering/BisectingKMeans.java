/**
 * An implementation of the Bisecting K-Means algorithm, also known as Repeated
 * Bisections.  This implementation is based on the following paper:
 *
 *   <li style="font-family:Garamond, Georgia, serif">Michael Steinbach,
 *   George Karypis, Vipin Kumar.  "A comparison of document clustering
 *   techniques," in <i>KDD Workshop on Text Mining</i>, 200</li>
 *
 * This clustering algorithm improves upon the standard K-Means algorithm by
 * taking a data set and repeatedly splitting the data points into two regions.
 * Initially all data points are separated into two clusters.  Then, until the
 * desired number of clusters are created, the largest cluster is divided using
 * K-Means with K equal to 2.  This implementation relies on the {@link
 * DirectClustering} implementation.  Any properties passed to this clustering
 * method are passed onto the {@link DirectClustering} algorithm, allowing the
 * user to set the desired seeding method.
