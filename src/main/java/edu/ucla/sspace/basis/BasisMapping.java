/**
 * An interface for specifying how a set of features can be mapped to a vector
 * basis.  In the naive case, each feature is mapped it its own dimension.
 * However, many approaches may use information about the feature to represent
 * several different features using a single dimension.  For example, each word
 * may correspond to a unique dimension regardless of how it is grammatically
 * related.
 *
 * </p>
 *
 * This interface also provides support for describing dimensions.  The named of
 * the description is left open to the implementation.  For example, an
 * implementation may chose to return a {@code String} with a human-readable
 * description.  Another implementation may return a {@code Set} of features
 * that are represented by the dimension in order to facilitate further
 * processing.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of feature being mapped to a dimension.
 * @param <E> the type of object to be used as a description of each dimension.
