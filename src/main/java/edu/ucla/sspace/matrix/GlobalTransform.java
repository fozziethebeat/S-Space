/**
 * An interface for matrix transformations.  Transformations that can be done
 * with either no knowledge of the given matrix or with only global knowledge,
 * such as row and column summations, can be implemented with this
 * transformation.  This is a supplement to the more general {@link Transform}
 * interface to fascilitate.  By implementing this interface, a transformation
 * can be done on any file type and any matrix type with little extra work.
 *
 * </p>Implementations are expected to gather any required statistics through
 * their constructor.  Afterwards, users of the transform may request each entry
 * in a matrix to be transformed based on it's row, column, and value.  Each
 * entry is welcome to interpret the meaning of row, column, and value
 * differently.  It is recomended that implementations be made a subclass of a
 * {@link Transform} implementation.  A good example is the {@link
 * TfIdfTransform}.
 *
 * </p> Note that most instances of a {@link GlobalTransform} should be used
 * with only one matrix.  Training on one matrix and applying the transformation
 * to another will often result in an unintelligible transformation.
 * Transformations that do not need to compute any statistics can be applied to
 * any matrix without any complications, such as a transformation that adds 5 to
 * every entry.
