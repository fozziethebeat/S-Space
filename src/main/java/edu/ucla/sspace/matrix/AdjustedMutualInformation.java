/**
 * This {@link MatrixAggregate} computes the <a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjusted_mutual_information">Adjusted
 * Mutual Information</a> between two factors whose interactions are stored
 * within a {@link Matrix}.  The rows of the {@link Matrix} should correspond to
 * factors for one variable while the columns should correspond to factors for a
 * separate variable.  The computed {@link AdjustedMutualInformation} then
 * represents the the amount of overlap between the two variables, as a value
 * between 0 and 1 where 1 is perfect overlap and 0 indicates no overlap.  This
 * measure is best used to compare two distinct clusterings of the same dataset.
 * Under this formulation, an {@link AdjustedMutualInformation} of {@code 1.0}
 * then indicates the two solutions are equivalent while {@code 0.0} indicates
 * that they share no significant groupings.
 *
 * </p>
 *
 * This implementation is based off of the following paper:
 * <li>
 *   Vinh, Nguyen Xuan and Epps, Julien and Bailey, James, "Information
 *   Theoretic Measures for Clusterings Comparison: Variants, Properties,
 *   Normalization and Correction for Chance," in <i>The Journal of Machine
 *   Learning Research</i>.  Available <a
 *   href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1756006.1953024">here</a>.</li>
 *
 * </p>
 *
 * We make one siginficant deviation from the standard {@link
 * AdjustedMutualInformation} measure.  If both variables have only one factor,
 * i.e. the matrix has one row and one column, we return an AMI of 1.0 to
 * indicate a perfect match between the two variables.  Techinically however,
 * the AMI should be 0.0 as there is no shared information.
 *
 * </p> 
 *
 * Implementation note: that the code for this computation is extremely complicated and
 * poorly documented as it's a translation of Matlab code optimized to avoid
 * computing too many factorials.
