/**
 * A utility for asserting what tokens are valid and invalid within a stream of
 * tokens.  A filter may be either inclusive or exclusive.<p>
 *
 * An inclusive filter will accept only those tokens with which it was
 * initialized.  For an example, an inclusive filter initialized with all of the
 * words in the english dictionary would exclude all misspellings or foreign
 * words in a token stream.<p>
 *
 * An exclusive filter will aceept only those tokens that are not in set with
 * which it was initialized.  An exclusive filter is often used with a list of
 * common words that should be excluded, which is also known as a "stop
 * list."<p>
 *
 * {@code TokenFilter} instances may be combined into a linear chain of filters.
 * This allows for a highly configurable filter to be made from mulitple rules.
 * Chained filters are created in a linear order and each filter must accept the
 * token for the last filter to return {@code}.  If the any of the earlier
 * filters return {@code false}, then the token is not accepted.<p>
 *
 * This class also provides a static utility function {@link
 * #loadFromSpecification(String) loadFromSpecification} for initializing a
 * chain of filters from a text configuration.  This is intended to facility
 * command-line tools that want to provide easily configurable filters.  An
 * example configuration might look like:
 * <tt>include=top-tokens.txt;test-words.txt,exclude=stop-words.txt</tt>
