/**
 * A utility class for representing a span of time.  Instance of this class can
 * be used to determine whether two moments fall within the time span.<p>
 *
 * Time spans are expressed as a combination of time units and their associated
 * amounts.  Each amount may add up to be more than one of a larger time unit.
 * For example a time unit may be expressed as 1 month and 6 weeks.  Time
 * amounts that are not used should be set to 0, e.g. a time span representing a
 * single day would have only {@code days} set to 1 and all other time units as
 * 0.<p>
 *
 * Note that when the overloaded {@code Date} and {@code long} methods are used,
 * the instances are converted to the JVM's current calendar system.  This may
 * have a slight, noticeable affect due to daylight savings or any other
 * calendar-specific differences to how a date is calculated.
